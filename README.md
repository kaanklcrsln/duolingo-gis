# duolingoGIS

**DuoGIS** is a next-generation interactive learning platform built with **React**, combining **Duolingo’s proven gamification methodology** with **geography education**.  
The platform aims to teach users about **world geography** and **cultural symbols (flags)** through an **interactive map interface**.

### Mission

To make world geography and cultures fun, interactive, and accessible for everyone — delivering a lasting learning experience inspired by the Duolingo methodology.

### Core Game Mechanic: Story Mode

DuoGIS presents learning as an **adventure**.  
Users begin their learning journey through the **Story Mode**, where they can select a continent and progress through geography challenges.

### Continent Selection
The user selects a continent (e.g., Europe, Asia) to start their learning path.

### Flag Matching
The system randomly displays country flags from the chosen continent.  
Users must either:
- Identify the correct country on the map, **or**
- Select its name from multiple choices.

### Progress & Scoring
- Each correct answer earns **points** and marks that country as **“learned.”**  
- Each incorrect guess reduces the player’s **“life” (heart)** count by one.  
- The level continues until all countries in the selected continent are learned.  
- If all lives are lost, the user must restart the level.
